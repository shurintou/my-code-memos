/* 
This is not a normal example.
I happend to meet this case, which I got some static html templates(with custom scripts and css imported)
and those custom scripts are mainly dealing with dom animation.
Then, these static templates are going to be transferred to Vue.js template,
but scripts and css in them can't not be modified.(well, according to some responsibility issue)
